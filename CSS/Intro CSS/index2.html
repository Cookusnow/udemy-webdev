    <h1>Metroid Dread</h1>

    <div id="plot">Samus’ story continues after the events of the Metroid™ Fusion game when she descends upon planet ZDR
        to investigate a mysterious transmission sent to the Galactic Federation. The remote planet has become overrun
        by vicious alien lifeforms and chilling mechanical menaces. Samus is more agile and capable than ever, but can
        she overcome the inhuman threat stalking the depths of ZDR?</div>
    <div id="robot">Once DNA-extracting research machines, the imposing E.M.M.I. are now hunting Samus down. Tensions
        are high as
        you evade these E.M.M.I. to avoid a cruel death while finding a way to take them down. Find out what turned
        these robotic wonders into the scourge of ZDR and escape with your life.</div>
    <div id="power">Acquire new and familiar abilities as you traverse the many environments of this dangerous world.
        Parkour over
        obstacles, slide through tight spaces, counter enemies, and battle your way through the planet. Return to areas
        and use your new abilities to find upgrades, alternate paths, and a way forward. Explore the sprawling map,
        evade and destroy E.M.M.I. robots, and overcome the dread plaguing ZDR.</div>
