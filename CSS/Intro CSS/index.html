    <h2>PLOT</h2>
    <p>Samus’ story continues after the events of the Metroid™ Fusion game when she descends upon planet ZDR to
        investigate a mysterious transmission sent to the Galactic Federation. The remote planet has become overrun by
        vicious alien lifeforms and chilling mechanical menaces. Samus is more agile and capable than ever, but can she
        overcome the inhuman threat stalking the depths of ZDR?

        Once DNA-extracting research machines, the imposing <a href="/nowhere">E.M.M.I.</a> are now hunting Samus down.
        Tensions
        are high as you evade these E.M.M.I. to avoid a cruel death while finding a way to take them down. Find out what
        turned these robotic wonders into the scourge of ZDR and escape with your life.
