        <p>The last Metroid is in captivity. The galaxy is at peace...</p>

        <p> I first battled the Metroids on planet Zebes. It was there that I foiled the plans of the Space Pirate
            leader
            Mother Brain to use the creatures to attack Galactic Civilization...
            I next fought the Metroids on their homeworld, SR388. I completely eradicated them except for a larva, which
            after hatching followed me like a confused child...
            I personally delivered it to the Galactic Research Station at Ceres so the scientists could study its energy
            producing qualities...
            The scientists' findings were astounding! They discovered that the powers of the Metroid might be harnessed
            for
            the good of civilization!
            Satisfied that all was well, I left the station to seek a new bounty to hunt. But, I had hardly gone beyond
            the
            asteroid belt when I picked up a distress signal!
            Ceres station was under attack!! </p>
